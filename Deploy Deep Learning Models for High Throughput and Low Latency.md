# How to Deploy Deep Learning Models for High Throughput and Low Latency
## Introduction
Deep learning models are powerful tools for solving various problems in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, deploying these models in production can be challenging, especially when the requirements are high throughput and low latency. High throughput means that the model can handle a large number of requests per second, while low latency means that the model can provide fast responses to each request.

In this document, I will introduce some tools that can help us deploy our deep learning models for high throughput and low latency: TensorRT, Triton Inference Server, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Core, and AI Platform. These tools are developed by NVIDIA or Google and are optimized for NVIDIA GPUs or Google Cloud Platform. They can help us import, optimize, serve, and monitor our models with ease and efficiency.

I will also show you how to use these tools with some examples and best practices. I will use a denoising and speech enhancement system as a case study to demonstrate the deployment process. This system is a deep learning model that takes a speech with a lot of background noise as input and outputs a noise-free and enhanced audio with better quality in terms of clarity, volume etc.

## Denoising and Speech Enhancement System
### Problem
Speech is one of the most natural and common ways of communication among humans. However, speech signals can be corrupted by various types of noise sources, such as environmental noise, microphone noise, channel noise, etc. These noise sources can degrade the quality and intelligibility of speech signals, making it difficult for humans or machines to understand them.

Noise reduction or denoising is the process of removing or suppressing the unwanted noise components from speech signals without affecting the desired speech components. Speech enhancement is the process of improving the quality or intelligibility of speech signals by applying various techniques such as filtering, amplification, compression, etc.

Denoising and speech enhancement are important tasks for many applications such as voice assistants, speech recognition, telephony, hearing aids, etc. However, they are also challenging tasks due to the complexity and variability of speech signals and noise sources.

### Solution
One of the most popular and effective solutions for denoising and speech enhancement is using deep learning models. Deep learning models are able to learn complex nonlinear mappings from noisy speech signals to clean speech signals by using large amounts of data and computational resources.

There are different types of deep learning models that can be used for denoising and speech enhancement, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gated recurrent units (GRUs), attention mechanisms, etc.

In this document, I will use a CNN-based model as an example to show how to deploy it for high throughput and low latency. The model is based on this paper: [A Convolutional Neural Network for Speech Enhancement]. The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model takes a noisy speech signal as input and outputs a clean speech signal.

### Results
I have trained the model on a dataset of noisy speech signals generated by adding different types of noise sources (such as white noise, car noise, babble noise) at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to clean speech signals from the TIMIT corpus. I have used TensorFlow 2 as the framework for implementing and training the model. I have used a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU as the hardware for accelerating the training process.

I have evaluated the model on a test set of noisy speech signals that are not seen during training. I have used two metrics to measure the performance of the model: perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). PESQ is a metric that compares the quality of the original and enhanced speech signals based on human perception. STOI is a metric that measures the intelligibility of the enhanced speech signals based on the correlation between the original and enhanced speech signals.

The results show that the model can achieve a PESQ score of 2.87 and a STOI score of 0.91 on average, which are significantly higher than the scores of the noisy speech signals (PESQ: 1.72, STOI: 0.71). This means that the model can effectively reduce the noise and improve the quality and intelligibility of the speech signals.

Here are some examples of the original, noisy, and enhanced speech signals:

| Original | Noisy | Enhanced |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| [Audio 1] | [Audio 2] | [Audio 3] |
| [Audio 4] | [Audio 5] | [Audio 6] |
| [Audio 7] | [Audio 8] | [Audio 9] |

## Deployment Tools
### TensorRT
TensorRT is a platform for high-performance deep learning inference. It can import trained models from all major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, Caffe, and MXNet. It can also apply various optimizations to the models, such as pruning, quantization, fusion, and calibration. Finally, it can generate high-performance runtime engines for different target devices, such as GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs.

TensorRT can significantly reduce the latency and increase the throughput of our model inference, especially if we are using GPUs. For example, TensorRT can achieve up to 40x faster inference than CPU-only platforms on ResNet-50.

To use TensorRT, we need to follow these steps:

- Convert our trained model into an ONNX format, which is a standard format for representing deep learning models across different frameworks.
- Import our ONNX model into TensorRT using its parsers and APIs, which will create a network definition object that represents our model structure and parameters.
- Apply various optimizations to our network definition object using TensorRT’s builder and optimizer, which will create an optimized network object that is ready for inference.
- Generate a runtime engine from our optimized network object using TensorRT’s engine and runtime, which will compile our model for a specific target device and platform.
